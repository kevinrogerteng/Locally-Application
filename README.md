##Description##

Locally is a web application that keeps track of restaurant, venues, or landmarks that you want to visit while on your trip. All you have to do is create a trip with a destination and add activities based on Yelp recommendation. 

##Technologies##

- Ruby on Rails
- Yelp API

##Developer's Note##
Locally was developed as partial fulfillment to General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. We were given 7 days to complete the MVP of our web application.

##What's Next?##
- re-develop locally using Angular JS
